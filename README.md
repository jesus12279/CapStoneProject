<h2> Project Details:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>This project came about with my curiosity towards games and how the game industry has evolved
    in the past years. Also to learn more about video games and find out what system sold the most and where the most
    profitable.</li>
    <li>Viewing the video Game dataset i decided to use the Global Sales as the target in my model to predict how much
    a certain platform would sale and compare them to the rest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals:</h2>

<p>The goal of the project is to have a 85% accuracy on sales</p>
<p>Another goal of mine in this project was to showcase the impact on sales the video game industry has had in the past years</p>

<h2>Problems:</h2>

<p>
    There is a lot of video games being as of 2020 due to the pandemic currently going on.
    COVID-19 has prevented people to go to physical stores to buy any physical copies but there is always online shopping.
    Fans of current trending games have been more active and spending more cash on products related to video games.
    There was not enought data in this dataset on the different platforms.
</p>
    
<h2>Recommendations for further developments:</h2>

<p>
    I would like to develop more features related to this subject.
    Also to be able to have more recent data on video games that where released after the year 2016
    I would like to develop a recommendation system for video games with data grabbed from reviews
</p>

<h2>Methods Used:</h2>

<p>
    Data Cleaning
    Data Organizing/Exploring
    Feature Engineering
    Machine Learning
    Data Visualization
    Predictive Modeling
</p>

<h2>Technologies:</h2>

<p>
    Python

    Matplotlib
    Numpy
</p>

<h2>How to navigate this repo:</h2>

<p>In order to navigate this repo and get the same results, you must first donwload the dataset either from Kaggle link or from download from this repo.</p>
<p>Navigate and adjust to you're liking the Data cleaning.ipynb file in order to break the data up. Thats how you get all those different game platform file names.</p>
<p>After all that is done open up the Regression models and vizualizations.ipynb file in order to access all the preprocessing and modeling done on this data.</p>
